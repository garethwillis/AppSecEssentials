# Application Security Training

## Understanding the Lab Environment 
### Basic Instructions
- You will need to use the root username and password whenever you need to authenticate to the computer. Username: **root**, Password: **we45**. There's another user in the VM, with Username: **we45** and password: **we45**
- All the examples and code from the lab are yours to keep. 
- We have used multiple tools for the lab. We have only used Open Source tools as we are only allowed to use open source tools, due to commercial licensing restrictions. 
- We also have a number of vulnerable machines running in Docker Containers on this Virtual Machine. Some of these are available open source and some of them have been developed by us at we45 for our training workshops
- You will need to use the Linux Command line to run all of the exercises today. However, please don’t fret if you are not familiar with Linux. The commands to run everything have been documented in the exercise manual.
- **IMPORTANT: The Machine you have been given is only 1024MB RAM, please increase it to 2048MB or 4096MB depending on your computer's capacity by right clicking on the imported Machine, going to `System` and increasing the RAM to 2048 MB**
